this must be where she lost my present and was looking for it  sludge sniffed the snow i looked in the snow for a package or the snow print of a package but the snow next to the sled marks was unbroken I nate the great was puzzled how could something drop off the sled and not be in the snow or leave a mark in the snow there were no footprints either

a special garden

she looked surprised she said your garden must be big he said that it is and he had plans to make it bigger he took the ladder out of the garage he set it up in the garden room  when he was on the ladder he could reach the top of the walls  now he could have trees in his garden he made a pear tree and a walnut tree he made vines to hang from the branches  he made birds nests in the trees  

it rained one night and he lay awake my garden will be gone he thought but it was not gone only a few vegetables were washed away
